# examples

This repository hosts self-contained examples demonstrating [MPoL](https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/) functionality. More info on each example can be found in the README.md within each example folder.

This repository is *not* continuously integrated with the rest of the codebase, because the computational demands are too significant. If you do encounter an error, please log it as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MPoL-dev/examples/issues).

* [Stochastic Gradient Descent](sgd/README.md) For a complete example using mock data, we recommend starting here.
